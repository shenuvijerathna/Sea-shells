                        seashell, hard exoskeleton of marine mollusks such as snails, bivalves, and chitons that serves
                        to protect and support their bodies. It is composed largely of calcium carbonate secreted by the
                        mantle, a skinlike tissue in the molluskâ€™s body wall. Seashells are usually made up of several
                        layers of distinct microstructures that have differing mechanical properties. The shell layers
                        are secreted by different parts of the mantle, although incremental growth takes place only at
                        the shell margin. One of the most distinctive microstructures is nacre, or mother-of-pearl,
                        which occurs as an inner layer in the shells of some gastropods and bivalves and in those of the
                        cephalopods Nautilus and Spirula.

        <p class="p">A seashell or sea shell, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually
            created by an animal or organism that lives in the sea. Most seashells are made by mollusks, such as snails,
            clams, and oysters to protect their soft insides.</p>
